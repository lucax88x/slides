<h1>what is good</h1>

<div>

<ul>
<li>isolation</li>
<li>separate ci/cd with separate deployment times</li>
<li>team/stream autonomy</li>
<li>technology flexibility</li>
<li>better scalability</li>
<li>isolated failures</li>
</ul>

</div>

<!--

4. Reusability:
[Micro FrontEnd]: It will make the Test suite also reusable. We just need to test once.

[Monolithic FrontEnd]: We might have to run the test suite redundantly. If we are working with different teams, then test cases
would be redundant.

5. Continuous Integration/Deployment:
[Micro FrontEnd]: Each micro frontend can be developed and deployed
independently, itâ€™s possible to set up a CI/CD pipeline for each micro frontend, allowing for faster development cycles and less downtime when deploying new features.

[Monolithic FrontEnd]: If something wrong will go in production and we want to roll back the commit. As CI/CD time would be more so total
downtime of the application would also be more, which might
lead to heavy revenue loss.
