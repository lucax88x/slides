<h1>vim grammar - verbs (operators)</h1>

<div>
Just as spoken language grammar has <strong>verbs</strong>, <strong>adjectives</strong> and <strong>subjects</strong>, so does the vim grammar.

The grammar has different <strong>verbs</strong> to begin with:

<ul>
<li>Copying (or <strong>y</strong>anking) in Vim with <strong>y</strong></li>
<li><strong>d</strong>eleting with <strong>d</strong></li>
<li><strong>p</strong>asting with <strong>p</strong></li>
<li><strong>c</strong>hanging with <strong>c</strong></li>
<li><strong>f</strong>finding with <strong>f</strong></li>
<li>..more</li>
</ul>

<strong>Verbs</strong> can do nothing alone, they need a followup, a <strong>subject</strong>.
</div>

---

<h1>vim grammar - subjects (motions)</h1>

<div>
Next, we can add motions. Each <strong>verb</strong> takes a <strong>subject</strong> for their action. 

<ul>
<li>numbers</li>
<li><strong>w</strong>ords</li>
<li><strong>b</strong>back - beginning of previous word</li>
<li>..more</li>
</ul>

--- 

<h1>vim grammar - adjectives and count</h1>

<div>
The count allows you to multiply the effect of your <strong>verb</strong> a count number of times.

the adjectives is inner and around tbd
</div>

---

<h1>vim grammar - composability</h1>

{verb}{count}{adjective}{subject} => {operator}{count}{adjective}{motion}
{count}{verb}{adjective}{subject} => {count}{operator}{adjective}{motion}

---

Most commands come in two, three or four parts. One version of the three-part structure goes like this: operator — text object — motion.

**Operators** are always one of ***d**elete*, ***c**hange*, ***v**isual select* and ***r**eplace*.

**Text objects** are always one of **i**nside* or ***a**round*.

There’s a ton of different motions but we’ll get into that in a second, for now we can think of the motion as a kind of target for the command. To take an example I could press dib, meaning delete inside block.

The operator is delete, the text object is inside and the motion is block. This deletes everything inside a block of (parentheses).

<!-- mention the abscence of "shortcuts" -->

<h1>modal editing</h1>

what is modal editor

**Normal** mode is for reading code and navigating quickly.
**Insert** mode is for when you want to add some code or text.
**Visual** mode is unique, the same as highlighting text with the mouse, but with the above Vim motions.
